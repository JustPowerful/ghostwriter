  <h1>Ghostwriter</h1>
</div>

Ghostwriter is a simple task management system written in Next.js with an automation tool to write a summary email of what you done recently to your boss without having to write it manually. The application uses OpenAI's API JavaScript Module to actually generate the email, you can play with the prompt and tweak it to improve it.

The future version of the application will include an automated scheduled mailing, including the main user validation before sending if the user enables the parameter.

I'm working on a good roadmap and if anyone wants to join this open-source project, please reach me at: ahmedaminedoudech@gmail.com
